        Pre-emphasize the signal, then compute the spectrogram with a 4ms frame length and 2ms step,
        then keep only the low-frequency half (the non-aliased half).
    labels (NFRAMES) - numpy array of labels (integers):
        Calculate VAD with a 25ms window and 10ms skip. Find start time and end time of each segment.
        Then give every non-silent segment a different label.  Repeat each label five times.

    The lossvalues should be computed using a CrossEntropy loss.
