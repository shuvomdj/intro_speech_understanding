def major_chord(f, Fs):
    '''
    Generate a one-half-second major chord, based at frequency f, with sampling frequency Fs.

    @param:
    f (scalar): frequency of the root tone, in Hertz
    Fs (scalar): sampling frequency, in samples/second

    @return:
    x (array): a one-half-second waveform containing the chord
    
    A major chord is three notes, played at the same time:
    (1) The root tone (f)
    (2) A major third, i.e., four semitones above f
    (3) A major fifth, i.e., seven semitones above f

def dft_matrix(N):

    Create a DFT transform matrix, W, of size N.
    
    @param:
    N (scalar): number of columns in the transform matrix
    
    @result:

    Fs (scalar): sampling frequency (samples/second)

    @return:
    f1, f2, f3: The three loudest frequencies (in Hertz)
      These should be sorted so f1 < f2 < f3.
